## API Examples

### Counter

#### Min/Max and Value

<Canvas of={stories.MinMax} />

#### Disabled State

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### Counter Group

#### Group Properties

All available counter-group properties:

<Canvas of={stories.GroupProperties} />

#### Available Slots

All available slots for both components:

<Canvas of={stories.Slots} />

### Event Handling

Listen for `input` events to react to user interactions.

<Canvas of={stories.Events} />

#### Custom Value Display

<Canvas of={stories.DropdownValueText} />

### Group Max/Min

The group counter max or min property sets the value for all counters in the group. If a counter has a max value set, the group max attribute will override it. All increment buttons as a result will be disabled to prevent the group of counters from exceeding the group max.

**Example has group max set to 12**

<Canvas of={stories.GroupMax} />

### Counter Max/Min

You can also individually set the max or min value for each counter in a group.

**Example has group max set to 12**

<Canvas of={stories.GroupCounterMax} />

### Dropdown with fullscreen bib

You can make the dropdown open in fullscreen at a specific breakpoint by setting `fullscreenBreakpoint`.

The default value of `fullscreenBreakpoint` is `sm`.

Breakpoint token can be found [here](https://auro.alaskaair.com/getting-started/developers/design-tokens)

To support fullscreen bib, setting the `bib.fullscreen.headline` slot is **REQUIRED**.
You can also set `bib.fullscreen.footer` slot to add any additional options on fullscreen view.

<Canvas of={stories.DropdownMobileProperties} />
