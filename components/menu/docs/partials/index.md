## Example(s)

### Default

A basic `auro-menu` element with nested `auro-menuoption` elements to generate a list.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (FILE:src=./../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
  <!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
</div>

<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (CODE:src=./../apiExamples/basic.html) -->
<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->

</auro-accordion>

### Using Keys

When setting the `value` property, matches are actually performed on the value of the `key` property of the `auro-menuoption` and not the `value` property. By default, the value of `key` is equal to the value of the `value` property. However, for advanced use cases, the `key` value can be overriden to allow for more specific matches.

In the below example, there is a list of "popular" options at the top, with the same values repeated underneath. To allow more specific selections, we can add a `key` attribute to the top options to allow them to be more specifically selected, or to prevent them from interfering with matches on the lower options.

In the below example, setting the value of the menu `'stops'` will select the bottom-most option with the value `'stops'`, and setting the value of menu to `'stops-top'` will select the top-most option with the value `'stops'` since the key now differs from the value. In either case, the resulting value of the menu will be `'stops'` because the resulting value of the menu is based on the `value` property and not the `key` property.

Due to a limitation with Lit change detection to the `value` property, if multiple options with the same exist and one is selected, you must first clear the current value before attempting to select another option with the same value, even if the keys are unique. See code example below.

_Note: Since the value passed to the `value` property when programmatically setting it is overwritten with the proper derived value once the menu has updated, note that it will take one lifecycle before the `value` property is updated to the value that represents the actual menu state._
