`<auro-combobox>` is the combination of [dropdown](http://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/dropdown), [input](http://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/input), and [menu](http://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/menu) and allows users to filter search results from a predefined list as they type. When the user starts typing in the text input, a dropdown of a menu shows up to display options that match the userâ€™s search.

By default, `auro-combobox` behaves as a suggestion list. This means any value may be typed into the combobox and the menu list presented effectively provides sample or suggestion options. With the use of the `persistInput` attribute the `auro-combobox` behaves as a filter of menu options. In this mode. typing into the input field will execute the filter but will not set the `value` of the combobox. The combobox value is set by selecting a menu option. Clicking the `X` clear button in the input will remove the current value of the HTML5 input causing the menu filter to reset as well as remove the current value of the combobox.
